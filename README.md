# Client-Server-Development
Implemented Slick Corousel on home page, showcasing life at RIT.
Used Particle.js library along with text animation on Home Screen.(The Textyle Library used used for the animation).
The text animation is overlayed on the Particle.js library. Getting them to work was tricky as it involved working with two js libraries with no conflict.

Used Jquery UI Library Accordian, Tabs.
Tabs were used in the UG_Minor Page

Used Js Grid Library with the employment table
The Custom headers were commented out as the filtering functionality was lost. However they are working fine if we remove the comments.

Used Iframes to call the Employment Map API functionality.
The Dependancy Injection was used throughout.
The Feedback from project2 is incorporated in the final project 3
